# Pydantic Logfire — Uncomplicated Observability — JavaScript SDK

From the team behind [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/), **Logfire** is an observability platform built on the same belief as our
open source library — that the most powerful tools can be easy to use.

Check the [Github Repository README](https://github.com/pydantic/logfire-js) for more information on how to use the SDK.
